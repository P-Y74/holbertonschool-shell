## Resources ‚ú®

Here are some useful materials to help you understand shell permissions:

- **File Permissions in Linux**
- **User and Group Management**
- **Understanding chmod, chown, chgrp**
- **Special Permissions (SUID, SGID, Sticky Bit)**
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**

### Commands Covered:

```bash
chmod, sudo, su, chown, chgrp, id, groups, whoami, adduser, useradd, addgroup
```

---

## Learning Objectives üéØ

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and manipulate file and directory permissions
- Use `chmod` to set permissions in symbolic and numeric mode
- Change file ownership with `chown`
- Modify group ownership using `chgrp`
- Utilize `sudo` and `su` for privilege escalation
- Understand special permissions like **SUID**, **SGID**, and **Sticky Bit**
- Work with **ACLs** to manage extended permissions
- Represent the three sets of permissions (owner, group, and other) as a single digit
- Explain why a normal user cannot use `chown` on a file
- Run commands with root privileges
- Change user ID or become a superuser
- Create users and groups
- Print real and effective user and group IDs
- Print the groups a user belongs to
- Print the effective user ID

---

## Project Requirements üëã

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Scripts must be exactly **two lines long** (`wc -l file` should print 2)
- The first line of each script must be `#!/bin/bash`
- Scripts must be executable (`chmod u+x filename.sh`)
- No use of **backticks**, `&&`, `||`, or `;`
- Tested on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder describing each script
- All files should end with a new line

---

## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shell-permissions.git
```

Navigate to the directory and make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod u+x script_name.sh
```

Run a script using:

```bash
./script_name.sh
```
